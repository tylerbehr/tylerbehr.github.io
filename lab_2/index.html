        <strong><h1>Re: Dover Cliff university application</h1></strong>
    </p> 
    
    <p>
        Dear Dover,<br> 
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's iSchool to study for your undergraduate in
        2020. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us
        at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the
        beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>First semester: 29 August 2019</li>
          <li>Second semester: 22 January 2020</li>
          <li>Third semester: 2 May 2020</li>
        </ul>
        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you
        would prefer. You can find more information about important university dates
        on our website. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
      At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in
      the realm of information studies. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated
      researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
      Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as
      follows, in order of priority:
      <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of
          funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience
          size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
      </ol>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd
      expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and
      anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. 
    </p>

      <h2>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</h2>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did
      study animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as
      follows, with definitions:
      <dl>
        <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
        <dd>A large predator, very hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.</dd>
        <dt>The elk</dt>
        <dd>An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia. It
            can be seen from railways, and also frequently visits the Banff centre forthe arts.</dd>
        <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic
            misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming noise
            associated with them on film. This cry is instead the call of the red-tail.</dd>
      </dl>
